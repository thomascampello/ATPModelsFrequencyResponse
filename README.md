This repository contains all scripts required to reproduce the simulation and numerical results presented in the paper.

##  üìÅ Scripts and Algorithms Files

| File   |	Description |
|--------|--------------|
| Main_TF.exe | Compiled executable of the proposed NFT algorithm. This executable was compiled as a generic program that takes the measured time-domain current waveforms as input.|
| run_TF_exe.m | Matlab script created to generate the input files for Main_TF.exe and to read the responses from it and generate the corresponding .mat files | 
| Fourier.m | The MATLAB script of the NFTA proposed in the paper. This file was used to compile and create the "Main_TF.exe" |
| Main_TF.m | Complementary script used with the "Fourier.m". This script is used to read the ATP curves saved as ".mat" by the PLOTXY program, run th "Fourier.m" and create an output file with the frequency response. This file was also used to compile and create the "Main_TF.exe" and the "run_TF_exe.m" |
